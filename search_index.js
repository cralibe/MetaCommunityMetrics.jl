The steps include:\n\nReorganization of Data: The input data is organized into a DataFrame with columns for abundance, time, plot, and species, and then transformed into a 3D abundance matrix.\nTotal Abundance Calculations: The function calculates total abundances for species across time, within each patch, and for the entire metacommunity.\nStandard Deviation (SD) Calculations: Temporal standard deviations of abundance are computed for the entire metacommunity, each patch, and each species.\nCV Calculations: The coefficients of variation are calculated for species and community biomass at both local and regional scales.\nOutput: The results are returned in a DataFrame summarizing the CVs for local and regional scales.\n\nExample\n\njulia> using MetaCommunityMetrics, Pipe\n\njulia> df = @pipe load_sample_data() |>\n            stack(_, Not(:Sampling_date_order, :Year, :Month, :Day, :plot), variable_name = :Species, value_name = :Abundance) |>\n            filter(row -> row[:Sampling_date_order] <= 15, _)\n5040×7 DataFrame\n  Row │ Year   Month  Day    Sampling_date_order  plot   Species  Abundance \n      │ Int64  Int64  Int64  Int64                Int64  String   Int64     \n──────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n    1 │  2010      1     16                    1      1  BA               0\n    2 │  2010      1     16                    1      2  BA               0\n    3 │  2010      1     16                    1      4  BA               0\n    4 │  2010      1     16                    1      8  BA               0\n    5 │  2010      1     16                    1      9  BA               0\n    6 │  2010      1     16                    1     11  BA               0\n    7 │  2010      1     16                    1     12  BA               0\n    8 │  2010      1     16                    1     14  BA               0\n    9 │  2010      1     16                    1     17  BA               0\n   10 │  2010      1     16                    1     22  BA               0\n   11 │  2010      1     16                    1      3  BA               0\n  ⋮   │   ⋮      ⋮      ⋮             ⋮             ⋮       ⋮         ⋮\n 5030 │  2011      2      5                   10     15  SO               0\n 5031 │  2011      2      5                   10     18  SO               0\n 5032 │  2011      2      5                   10     19  SO               0\n 5033 │  2011      2      5                   10     20  SO               0\n 5034 │  2011      2      5                   10     21  SO               0\n 5035 │  2011      2      5                   10      5  SO               0\n 5036 │  2011      2      5                   10      7  SO               0\n 5037 │  2011      2      5                   10     10  SO               0\n 5038 │  2011      2      5                   10     16  SO               0\n 5039 │  2011      2      5                   10     23  SO               0\n 5040 │  2011      2      5                   10     24  SO               0\n                                                           5018 rows omitted\n\njulia> CV_summary_df = CV_meta_simple(df.Abundance, df.Sampling_date_order, df.plot, df.Species)\n1×4 DataFrame\n Row │ CV_s_l   CV_s_r    CV_c_l    CV_c_r  \n     │ Float64  Float64   Float64   Float64 \n─────┼──────────────────────────────────────\n   1 │ 1.52817  0.687386  0.932183  0.31225\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"VariabilityMetrics/#References","page":"Variability Metrics Functions","title":"References","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"VariabilityMetrics/","page":"Variability Metrics Functions","title":"Variability Metrics Functions","text":"Wang, S., Lamy, T., Hallett, L.

By comparing empirical data with randomized permutations, one can determine the extent to which niche and dispersal processes influence the structure of metacommunities. Before calculating the DNCI, groupings of sites (clusters) are required, as the DNCI relies on analyzing community composition across spatial groups. This package provides a function to perform the necessary clustering, which is not available in the equivalent R package. When the DNCI value is significantly below zero, dispersal processes are likely the dominant drivers of community composition. In contrast, a DNCI value significantly above zero suggests that niche processes play a primary role in shaping community composition. If the DNCI value is not significantly different from zero, it indicates that dispersal and niche processes contribute equally to variations in community composition.","category":"page"},{"location":"DNCI/#The-Functions","page":"Dispersal-Niche Continuum Index (DNCI) Functions","title":"The Functions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"DNCI/","page":"Dispersal-Niche Continuum Index (DNCI) Functions","title":"Dispersal-Niche Continuum Index (DNCI) Functions","text":"create_clusters: Groups sampling locations based on their spatial attributes and species richness, which can then be used to assess DNCI.\nplot_clusters: Visualizes the clusters created, allowing for an intuitive understanding of spatial groupings.\nDNCI_multigroup: Computes the Dispersal-Niche Continuum Index (DNCI) across multiple groups, helping to quantify the relative influence of niche versus dispersal processes.","category":"page"},{"location":"DNCI/","page":"Dispersal-Niche Continuum Index (DNCI) Functions","title":"Dispersal-Niche Continuum Index (DNCI) Functions","text":"create_clusters\nplot_clusters","category":"page"},{"location":"DNCI/#MetaCommunityMetrics.create_clusters","page":"Dispersal-Niche Continuum Index (DNCI) Functions","title":"MetaCommunityMetrics.create_clusters","text":"create_clusters(time::Vector{Int}, latitude::Vector{Float64}, longitude::Vector{Float64}, patch::Vector{Int}, total_richness::Vector{Int}) -> Dict{Int, DataFrame}\n\nThis function creates clusters (groupings of patches/sites) for each unique time step in a dataset which can then used for calculating DNCI.

It incorporates checks and adjustments to ensure the following conditions are met: at least 2 clusters, a minimum of 5 patches/sites per cluster, and that the variation in the number of taxa/species and patches/sites per group does not exceed 40% and 30%, respectively.

continuum index (DNCI) for multiple groups, a metric proposed by Vilmi(2021). The DNCI quantifies the balance between dispersal and niche processes within a metacommunity, providing insight into community structure and the relative influence of these two key ecological drivers.\n\nArguments\n\ncomm::Matrix: A presence-absence data matrix where rows represent observations (e.g., sites or samples) and columns represent species.\ngroups::Vector: A vector indicating the group membership for each row in the comm matrix. You can the create_clusters function to generate the group membership.\nNperm::Int=1000: The number of permutations for significance testing. Default is 1000.\ncount::Bool=true: A flag indicating whether the numeber of permutations is printed. Default is false.\n\nReturns\n\nDataFrame: A DataFrame containing the DNCI value, the associate confiden interval (CI_DNCI) and variance (S_DNCI) for each pair of groups.\n\nDetails\n\nThe function calculates the DNCI for each pair of groups in the input data.\nWhen the DNCI value is significantly below zero, dispersal processes are likely the dominant drivers of community composition. \nIn contrast, a DNCI value significantly above zero suggests that niche processes play a primary role in shaping community composition. \nIf the DNCI value is not significantly different from zero, it indicates that dispersal and niche processes contribute equally to variations in community composition.\n\nExample\n\njulia> using MetaCommunityMetrics, Random, Distributions\n\njulia> Random.seed!(1234)\nTaskLocalRNG()\n\njulia> time = vcat(fill(1, 20), fill(2, 20), fill(3, 20)) \n60-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 1\n 1\n ⋮\n 3\n 3\n\njulia> latitude = rand(Uniform(34.0, 35.0), 60)\n60-element Vector{Float64}:\n 34.57986212013413\n 34.41129411794985\n 34.97213608245547\n  ⋮\n 34.57432348527832\n 34.67764990759958\n\njulia> longitude = rand(Uniform(-118.0, -117.0), 60)\n60-element Vector{Float64}:\n -117.91655991056788\n -117.47420433613088\n -117.15935908052177\n    ⋮\n -117.92682908601348\n -117.49824402144651\n\njulia> patch = rand(1:10, 60) \n60-element Vector{Int64}:\n 10\n  2\n  4\n  ⋮\n  6\n  9\n\njulia> total_richness = rand(5:50, 60)\n60-element Vector{Int64}:\n 37\n 40\n  6\n  ⋮\n 48\n 28\n\njulia> result = create_clusters(time, latitude, longitude, patch, total_richness)\nDict{Int64, DataFrame} with 3 entries:\n  2 => 20×6 DataFrame…\n  3 => 20×6 DataFrame…\n  1 => 20×6 DataFrame…\n\njulia> println(result[1])\n20×6 DataFrame\n Row │ Time   Latitude  Longitude  Patch  Total_Richness  Group \n     │ Int64  Float64   Float64    Int64  Int64           Int64 \n─────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n   1 │     1   34.5799   -117.917     10              37      1\n   2 │     1   34.4113   -117.474      2              40      2\n   3 │     1   34.9721   -117.159      4               6      2\n   4 │     1   34.0149   -117.476      9              45      1\n   5 │     1   34.5204   -117.987      7              29      1\n   6 │     1   34.6396   -117.594      5              18      2\n   7 │     1   34.8396   -117.876     10               7      1\n   8 │     1   34.9671   -117.351      1              34      2\n   9 │     1   34.7898   -117.085      4              23      2\n  10 │     1   34.696    -117.666      9              24      1\n  11 │     1   34.5667   -117.652      8              19      1\n  12 │     1   34.5364   -117.471     10              45      2\n  13 │     1   34.7114   -117.042      5              43      2\n  14 │     1   34.1039   -117.979      2              46      1\n  15 │     1   34.8067   -117.637     10               8      2\n  16 │     1   34.8705   -117.997      7              33      1\n  17 │     1   34.9627   -117.369      9              48      1\n  18 │     1   34.1512   -117.165      4              27      2\n  19 │     1   34.7154   -117.12       8              34      1\n  20 │     1   34.9395   -117.247      5              13      2\n\n\ncomm = [1 0 0 1 0;\n        1 1 0 0 0;\n        0 1 1 0 0;\n        0 0 1 1 1;\n        1 0 0 0 1;\n        0 1 1 0 1]\n\ngroups = [\"A\", \"A\", \"B\", \"B\", \"C\", \"C\"]\nNperm = 1000\ncount = false\n\nresult = DNCI_multigroup(comm, groups, Nperm; count)\nprintln(result)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"DNCI/#References","page":"Dispersal-Niche Continuum Index (DNCI) Functions","title":"References","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"DNCI/","page":"Dispersal-Niche Continuum Index (DNCI) Functions","title":"Dispersal-Niche Continuum Index (DNCI) Functions","text":"Clarke, K.

The original rodent abundance data were collected monthly across 24 plots, recording a total of 24 species. For the purposes of this package, the data are filtered for the period from 2010 to 2023, transformed into long format, and species that were not recorded during this period are removed. Additionally, plots with no observations at a given time step are excluded. A new column, Sampling_date_order, was created to sequentially number the sampling dates, starting at 1 and continuing through 117, to facilitate analysis. The locations of the plots (Latitude and Longitude) were simulated for testing the DNCI functions.
