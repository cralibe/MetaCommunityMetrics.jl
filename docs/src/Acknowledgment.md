## Acknowledgment
We are grateful to the authors of the pre-existing R package/implementation that we have
implemented in MetaCommunityMetrics.jl. We express our gratitude to everyone who has
tried out this package and provided feedback on how to improve it, especially people from
the Entomological Data Science Lab at Cornell University. 

This package includes re-implementation and adaptations of functions from the R packages `adespatial` (licensed under GPL-3), `vegan` (licensed under GPL-2 or later), `DNCImper` (licensed under GPL-3), and `MVNH` (licensed under GPL-3). The original packages and their documentation are available at:

This package also includes re-implementation and adaptations of scripts that are provided by these papers:
