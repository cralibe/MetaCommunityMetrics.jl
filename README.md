# MetaCommunityMetrics
`MetaCommunityMetrics` is a collection of tools and utilities for analyzing meta-communities in Julia. The current version is compatible with `julia` version 1.9.3.

## An Overview
This package is a comprehensive toolkit designed to characterize the spatiotemporal structure and dynamics of a metacommunityâ€”a network of communities linked by the dispersal of multiple, interacting species, each with unique niche breadths. It includes functions to calculate a range of specific metrics, which have been previously implemented in R and proven valuable for metacommunity analysis. 

However, they come with high computational costs, especially for large species community datasets. To address this issue, MetaCommunityMetrics.jl was developed in Julia, a programming language known for its efficiency in handling computationally intensive tasks. This implementation significantly improves the efficiency of calculating these metrics, making it a powerful tool for metacommunity analysis. 

These metrics include:
- Beta diversity and its components: total diversity, species replacement (turnover), and richness differences for both presence-absence and abundance data
- Dispersal-niche continuum index to evaluate the degree to which communities are influenced by dispersal processes and niche breadth
- Niche overlap indices to determine the extent of niche sharing among species within the metacommunity
- The proportion of habitat patches occupied by each species
- The variability of community composition across different spatial and temporal scales


## Getting Started

### Installation

To install MetaCommunityMetrics, use the following command:

```julia
using Pkg

Pkg.add("MetaCommunityMetrics")

using MetaCommunityMetrics
```
